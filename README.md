# Githopper

![Banner](banner.png)

Githopper is a powerful open-source Git interface for grasshopper that makes working with Git both safe and beginner-friendly.

## Git

Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world. it is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.

## Main Features

* Custom Git commands could be added without the need to modify the pluginâ€™s source code.
* Complex situations are avoided as much as possible; making it safer for experimentation.
* Git operations are simplified without reducing their capability.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your device.

### Prerequisites

1. The Main software prerequisite for Githopper is the appropriate [Git software](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your OS. I recommend using the latest available stable version of Git.

2. If you are using Rhino5, you need to install the [GHPYTHON](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython) Plugin for Rhino5, although I recommend using the Rhino6 for the best performance.

3. In some Windows versions, the Rhino must be set to run as administrator to be able to work with repositories inside the C drive.

### Installing

* The latest stable release of the Githopper is available on the [food4rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/) website.
* In order to view, edit or copy component codes inside grasshopper, open the Githopper.gh file (all components are written in Python).
* In order to view, edit or copy compilable component codes outside grasshopper go to the [Compile Ready codes](https://github.com/oliaee/Githopper/tree/master/Compile%20Ready%20codes) Folder.
